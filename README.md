This is a solution to the [Clipboard landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

As most of my work, this solution is being constantly updated as I learn new things and find better solutions for my problems :)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first bigger project I completed on Frontend Mentor. I feel like I learned a lot about writing clean code, refactoring and getting back to the same project day after day. That being said, there's room for improvement and I still feel like my code is probably longer than it should be.

### Continued development

I'll continue to work on larger projects and try to develop a more efficient workflow.
